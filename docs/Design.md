## Color and meaning

As you know we use tailwindcss for styling. Here is the color and meaning of the colors we use in the project.

- `teal` as primary color, use for actionable items
- `violet` as secondary color, use for highlighting items
- `red` as danger color
- `green` as success color
- `gray` as neutral color
